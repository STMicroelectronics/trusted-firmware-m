  STMicroelectronics's STM32 MCUs intregrate a GPIO and Pin mux/config hardware
  controller. This part is focused on gpio bank configuration.

compatible: "st,stm32-gpio"

include: [gpio-controller.yaml, base.yaml]

properties:
  reg:
    required: true

  clocks:
    required: true

  "#gpio-cells":
    const: 2

  st,bank-name:
    type: string
    description:
      Should be a name string for this bank as specified in the datasheet.
    enum:
      - GPIOA
