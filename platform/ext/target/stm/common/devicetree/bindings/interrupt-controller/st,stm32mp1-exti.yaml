      Applicable for platforms implementing the RIF. Used to affect the CID
      number to a particular CPU in EXTI. On STM32MP2x platforms CPU1 = A35,
      CPU2 = M33 and CPU3 = M0+. As EXTI does not know which is the CID for
      each CPU, is must be set.
      For EXTI 1, <1 RIF_CID1>, <2 RIF_CID2>;
      For EXTI 2, <1 RIF_CID1>, <2 RIF_CID2>, <3 RIF_CID3>;
