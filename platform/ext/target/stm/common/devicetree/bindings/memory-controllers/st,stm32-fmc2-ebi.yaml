  The FMC2 functional block makes the interface with: synchronous and
  asynchronous static devices (such as PSNOR, PSRAM or other memory-mapped
  peripherals) and NAND flash memories.
  Its main purposes are:
    - to translate AXI transactions into the appropriate external device
      protocol
    - to meet the access time requirements of the external devices
  All external devices share the addresses, data and control signals with the
  controller. Each external device is accessed by means of a unique Chip
  Select. The FMC2 performs only one access at a time to an external device.

    description: |
      Continuous clock enable (first bank must be configured
      in synchronous mode). The FMC_CLK is generated continuously
      during asynchronous and synchronous access. By default, the
      FMC_CLK is only generated during synchronous access.

  st,fmc2-ebi-cs-clk-period-ns:
    type: int
    description: |
      This property defines the FMC_CLK output signal period in
      nanoseconds.
