  STM32 OSPI Memory Interface allows a SPI flash or HyperFlash connected to
  the SoC to be accessed via the external address space.

  The flash chip itself should be represented by a subnode of the STM32 OSPI
  Memory Interface node. The flash interface is selected based on the
  "compatible" property of this subnode:
  - if it contains "jedec,spi-nor", then SPI is used;
  - if it contains "spi-nand", then SPI is used.
  - if it contains "cfi-flash", then HyperFlash is used.
