  The STM32 Octo Memory Manager is a low-level interface that enables an
  efficient OCTOSPI pin assignment with a full I/O matrix (before alternate
  function map) and multiplex of single/dual/quad/octal SPI interfaces over
  the same bus.

      Configure the chip select selector override for the 2 OCTOSPIs.
      The 2 bits mask muxing description is:
        -bit 0: Chip select selector override setting for OCTOSPI1
          0x0: the chip select signal from OCTOSPI1 is sent to NCS1
          0x1: the chip select signal from OCTOSPI1 is sent to NCS2
        -bit 1: Chip select selector override setting for OCTOSPI2
          0x0: the chip select signal from OCTOSPI2 is sent to NCS1
          0x1: the chip select signal from OCTOSPI2 is sent to NCS2

      Configure the muxing between the 2 OCTOSPIs busses and the 2 output ports.
      The muxing 2 bits mask description is:
        - 0x0: direct mode, default
        - 0x1: mux OCTOSPI1 and OCTOSPI2 to port 1
        - 0x2: swapped mode
        - 0x3: mux OCTOSPI1 and OCTOSPI2 to port 2
