  STMicroelectronics STPMIC2 Power Management IC

  The PMIC has seven buck converters and eight LDOs. All need to be defined as
  children nodes, strictly following the BUCK1..7, LDO1..8 node names. For
  example:

  pmic2: stpmic2@33 {
    reg = <0x33>;
    ...
    regulators {
      compatible = "st,stpmic2-regulators";

      buck1 {
        /* all properties for buck1 */
      };
      ...
      buck7 {
        /* all properties for buck7 */
      };
      ldo1 {
        /* all properties for ldo1 */
      };
      ...
      ldo8 {
        /* all properties for ldo8 */
      };
    };
  };

compatible: "st,stpmic2-regulators"
