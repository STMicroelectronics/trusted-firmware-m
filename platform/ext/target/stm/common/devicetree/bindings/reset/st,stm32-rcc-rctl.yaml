  STM32 Reset and Clock Control (RCC) node.
  This node is in charge of reset control.

  To specify the reset line in a peripheral, the standard resets property needs
  to be used, e.g.:

    usart5: serial@xxx {
        ...
        /* Cell contains information about RCU register offset and bit */
        resets = <&rctl UART5_R>;
        ...
    };

  RCC reset cells are available in
  include/dt-bindings/reset/stm32{soc_family}_resets.h header files.
