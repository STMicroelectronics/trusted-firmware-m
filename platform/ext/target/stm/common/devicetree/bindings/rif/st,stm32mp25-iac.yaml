  The RIF (resource isolation framework) is a comprehensive set of hardware blocks
  designed to enforce and manage isolation of STM32 hardware resources such as memory
  and peripherals.

  The RIF uses the IAC (illegal access controller) to centralize the detection of RIF-related
  illegal accesses, managed by a secure application running in the trusted domain.
