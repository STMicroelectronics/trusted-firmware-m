  The RIF (resource isolation framework) is a comprehensive set of hardware
  blocks designed to enforce and manage isolation of STM32 hardware resources,
  like memory and peripherals.
  Through RISAB registers, a trusted domain application, or the application to
  whom the page configuration has been delegated, assigns memory pages to one or
  more security domains (secure, privilege, compartment).

      When set, this bit allows secure read/write data accesses to non-secure
      blocks and pages (secure execute remains illegal).
