  The RIF (resource isolation framework) is a comprehensive set of hardware
  blocks designed to enforce and manage isolation of STM32 hardware resources,
  like memory and peripherals.
  Through RISAF registers, a trusted domain application, or the application to
  whom the configuration has been delegated, assigns memory regions and
  subregions to one or more security domains (secure, privilege, compartment).
  RISAF managing DRR includes the DDR memory cipher engine (DDRMCE) feature.
