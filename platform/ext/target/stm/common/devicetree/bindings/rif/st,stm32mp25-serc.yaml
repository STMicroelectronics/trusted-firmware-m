  The RIF (resource isolation framework) is a comprehensive set of hardware blocks
  designed to enforce and manage isolation of STM32 hardware resources such as memory
  and peripherals.

  The RIF uses the SERC (Software error robustness collector) to detects accesses on target peripherals
  that are either shutdown (computing clock off), or under reset. Managed by a secure application
  running in the trusted domain.
