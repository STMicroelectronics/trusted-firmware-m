      Use to set the OSPI delay block within SYSCFG to:
        - Tune the phase of the RX sampling clock (or DQS) in order
        to sample the data in their valid window.
        - Tune the phase of the TX launch clock in order to meet setup
        and hold constraints of TX signals versus the memory clock.

    description: The Address Mapping Control Register (AMCR) is used
      to split the 256MB memory map area shared between the 2 OSPI
      Memory Interface (OMI). The Octo Memory Manager sets the AMCR
      depending of the memory-region configuration.
