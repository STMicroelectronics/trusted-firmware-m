      Use to set the OSPI delay block within SYSCFG to:
        - Tune the phase of the RX sampling clock (or DQS) in order
        to sample the data in their valid window.
        - Tune the phase of the TX launch clock in order to meet setup
        and hold constraints of TX signals versus the memory clock.
